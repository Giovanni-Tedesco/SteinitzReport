The result that we are interested in discussing is known as Steinitz's
Theorem.

\begin{restatable}[Steinitz's Thoerem]{thm}{steinitz}
\label{thm:steinitz}
  If $M$ and $N$ are algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0 such that
  $|M| = |N| = \aleph_{0}$ then $M \cong N$.
\end{restatable}

In essence what this says is that any two algebraically closed fields of
characteristic 0 that have the same cardinality are isomorphic. In order to
provide a proof of this result we are going to need to introduce a handful of
notions from both model theory and algebra.
